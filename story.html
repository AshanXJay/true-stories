     <p>Since of my childhood I am really love to sea diving.As a result of my burning desire,I learnt to do sea diving and I started 
	 to dive even from my young age.<br>When I was going through it,it was a inspiring ad riverting adventure to me.Sea diving,a mesmerizing 
	 adventure that transport me to a world beyond imagination.I think diving ia an investment<br> of time and money,but the rewards can be life 
	 changing,litterally.Timi Waters once said that "Being underwater reminds me of the beuty in life's simplicity.The sea pulses with 
     life.It exudes it,breathes it,a constant reminder that everything is liquid."</p>

	     <p>I got so many advantages to my life that I have never experienced.<br>I could see beauty of under sea.I was not only different
		 colors  different types of corals, sea plants,fishes but also the old construction's parts also.It made me wonder and curious about 
		 under sea world.I wanted to  dive more deeply and diffenrent exiciting places also.Beneath the ocean's surface lies a realm of wonder,
		 where vibrant hues dancs through the water.Corals reefs,like the Great Barrier Reef,showcase a pallette of bliues,yellow, and
		 pinks.Intricate ecosystem thrive here,with each organism playing a vital role.From tiny plankton to majestic whales,life pulses in 
		 harmony.</p>

  <p>I have tired different places not only  Sri Lanka but also in the abroad countries. As I am diving ,I needed to collect  
  memories with this unsual wonderful world.So I bought a camera  for photographing.It was a transformtive experiece.Under the sea,where the 
world takes on an ethereal hue,photography becomes a dance of light and shadow.Underwater phtotgraphy captures all of the beuty.Colors,light,
and mysterious creatues.It's like having a widow into a hidden world below the surface.Imagine azure waters streching as far as the eye can 
see,sunlight filtering through the liquid veil,and a symphony of marine creatures dancing in harmony.  </p>

             <p>one day decided to dive Hikkaduwa belongs to Sri Lanka sea area.If was my 3rd time to dive there.I started <br>to dive 
			 as usual .I wanted to dive so deep to started to get photographs about bunch of fishes ,plants and corals that I 
			 never see.<br>As a result I got so many nice  pictures and It was to be fun to me.<br> Underwater photography takes us on a 
			 journey beneath the waves,revealing a hidden universe teeming with life. It's like stepping into another dimention one where 
             gravity seems to lose its grip,and colors dance in surreal patterns.Underwater macro photography zooms in on tiny wonders a seahorse's intricate pattern,a nudibrach's vibrant body,or the delicate fronds of a fan coral.These close-ups reveal the beuty of miniaturized landscapes.Beneath the surface,light behaves differetly.Sunrays pierce through the water,creating ethernal beams that illuminate coral reefs,schools of fish,and mysteirious shipwrecks.Shadows play hide and seek,adding drama and depth to the scene.   <br>Underwater photography isn't just about technical skill ,It's about connecting with the ocean's soul and sharing its secrets through the lens.			 </p>

         <p>But when I was photographing them,they got attack me and they pushed  me down.I felt heelpless despair and uneasiness.I
		 got so many attemts to escape from them.But it was really difficult task to me. They started  not only literally push and pull me.
		 My whole arms and legs  were completely out of my control.Luckily after few minutes one of friend saw me and she tried to rescue 
                 me.</p>

         <p>After applied so many tricks on them ,I able to rescure from the massive fish attack .This experience is a unforgettable and 
            breath-taking moment in my life.Remember, most marine animals won't harm you unless provoked.Respect their habitat, maintain good 
diving practices,and enjoy the underwater world safetly.Experience can shape our uderstanding and wisdom,whether gained through practical contact,observation,or personal encounters. So,embrance life's adventures and learn from each moment!</p>
